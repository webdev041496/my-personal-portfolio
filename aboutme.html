    <h2>A Little About Me!</h2>


    <p>
        Hi, I’m David Lewis and this is a bit about myself!  I’m a full stack software developer who enjoys building and designing computer projects, but I’m also someone who enjoys a wide variety of activities. I enjoy sitting and reading a book, canoeing or boating on the water, trying new restaurants, or hanging out with friends and family. I also like playing cornhole, watching martial arts (I am a 2nd degree blackbelt in Tae Kwon Do), tinkering with robot kits, and watching a mystery, adventure or action movie.
        Some of my favorite memories come from unique adventures. I spent over five years as an oyster gardener and volunteered with the Chesapeake Bay Foundation. I worked on a shark research project in Florida, where we caught, tagged and collected data on sharks up to six feet long before releasing them back into the water.  It was an incredible experience!  I once flew to California to attend a surfing camp, and I’ve also worked on a horse breeding farm, helping with everything from feeding animals to watching foals being born. </ br>
        I’m proud to be an Eagle Scout, and my project was designing and building an outdoor classroom for my high school. My Christian faith is very important to me, and I enjoy studying the Bible. I try to live by honesty and trust, and I’m very patriotic and grateful to be an American. </ br>
        I also love to travel. I’ve been to England, France, Ireland, Mexico, Jamaica, Antigua, and the Grand Cayman.  I’d love to visit many more places; Japan and the Netherlands are at top of my list. Oh, I can’t forget, I also like to play the saxophone.        
    </p>
